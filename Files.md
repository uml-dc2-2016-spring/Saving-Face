# Files

A list of all important files and their purposes:

# camera.js
   effectively the main file of all the camera related functions. Here is where all the calls to the APIs utilized are made such as imgur's api and the face++ api. Holds code regarding the accounts it stores and what to do with said information when functions are called.
 
# server.js
  This is where the server is run and what needs to be called through the node.js command prompt in order for the rest of the code to run smoothly. It creates the local site that can be accessed from the computer.

# home.html
  This serves as the home page of an arbitrary website that would have it's user login or register before showing information.
  
# registration.html 
  Serves as the page where one can register their account for a site using a username, password and picture taken via webcam.
  
# login.html
  Serves as the login page of the site where the user logs in with their username, password and they then submit a picture that'll be compared to what the system has stored for that user. All html pages are very basic in design.
