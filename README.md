# Project Description
Using OpenCV, create additional account security that goes beyond username and password that will also compare images of the account owner with image of the person currently trying to access account.
  
  # Progress (Week 03/29)
I have made some early test files for both the server that's using node.js code, and made html file that can actually access the camera of the user along with taking a picture. During the latter's test I learned that on chrome one needs a special certificate for security reasons in order to access the functions that use the camera. Luckily Mozilla Firefox's browser does not require such a feature. This project for the sake of completion will be mostly done via testing on Mozilla as a result, though the code should work on most web browers given the correct credentials. Mostly finished the tutorials on node.js to dive into setting up server, example server code uploaded into a branch for test code.
 
 Have also begun working on getting all html pages to operate together on the same server.js file and plan to work on the class for "user accounts".
